Module 14 Challenge

In this assignment, I was asked to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site, which catalogs the microbes that colonize in human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
